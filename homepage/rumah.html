            <strong style="cursor: pointer;">Why is Facebook is not popular in Japan?</strong><br><br>

                Facebook is not popular because of difference of culture.
                Many people use LINE instead. On Facebook, you need to use your real name but many Japanese hesitate to use real name on SNS because we consider it is a risk to use real name. 
                For example, attitude to your boss is different from attitude to your friends. 
                However, you can’t control context on Facebook. That is a reason why Facebook is not popular in Japan.
                Line is a grope oriented SNS and uses a nick name unlike Facebook. <br><br>

            <div class="hide-content">
                So, group oriented people prefer LINE. Since LINE is a group oriented SNS, sometimes you can be omitted from a list and it is called LINE burring. On Quora, I see some people complain that Japanese culture is so closed to foreign people. 
                However, many Japanese feel the same way too. When you want to say whatever you want to say, you need to be anonymous. <br><br>
                In Japan, Twitter is also popular because you don’t have to reveal your real identity there. 
                So discussion on Twitter can be very very rough sometimes.
                I use Facebook because I learned how to use SNS in the US and have friends to keep in touch. 
                Also many expats who experienced foreign countries have their accounts. 
                In that sense, you can find many Japanese people on Facebook.

            <strong style="cursor: pointer;">Why is it so difficult to find a job in Singapore especially if one is not a PR or citizen?</strong>
            <br><br>
                Okay, so what Finn Koh said is essentially correct from a legal standpoint. 
                However it completely overlooks some real-life practical implications that makes the job search daunting for a foreigner in Singapore. 
                One thing is what the government says on paper, another thing is what happens behind the scenes. Now let’s get into it :
            <br><br>            
                1.	Employment Pass (the type of work permit used mostly by white collars earning above 3.6k SGD) yes it has no quota. 
                IN THEORY. However, once you look in practice, year after year, the number of EPs working in Singapore has been steady. 
                These are the numbers for the past five years: 178,900 187,900 192,300 187,700 185,800 193,700. 
                Once you see this it becomes pretty clear that it cannot be a coincidence, that essentially for each EP leaving there is one being granted in essence. 
                The quota is not there formally but strangely the numbers remain steady. 
                Whether this is regulated via the government conveniently not approving visas when demands are too high or by pressuring the companies in other ways, does not matter much. 
                Thing is, there is a cap, it shows in the numbers, this is not simply limited demand. Companies knows it.
            <br><br>
            <div class="hide-content2">
                2.	Another secret to those in the know is that for EP the 3.6k quota is just another formal number with little real-life applicability. 
                Earning 4k might get you an EP if you’re from Hong Kong, China or in general one nationality that is liked because it contributes to the Chinese portion of the population. 
                If you come from USA or Europe for example expect your application to be rejected below anything like 6–7K.
            <br><br>
                3.	While EPs are theoretically not capped, there is a more subtle way in which the government manages to regulate the number of foreigners entering the companies. 
                They do it via the so-called TAPEF (Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices). 
                Essentially this entity at the intersection of different parties, that know nothing about the specifics of your industry nor bother understanding your manpower needs, 
                will simply come down on you and ‘blacklist you’ or give you a warning for practicing “discriminatory practices against the locals”, as soon as you hire more foreigners than they would like. 
                So much for the EP quota being uncapped right? Now it is of little help to explain why the talent pool for the particular roles you’re searching is not available in Singapore 
                or why you found more qualified candidates elsewhere. They simply won’t listen until you re-balance the ratio by hiring more locals or getting rid of foreigners, so they can pull you out of the blacklist. 
                Essentially via this mechanism they can block any further EP application for your company. 
                So now you know why most companies, regardless of EP being formally uncapped, will be very careful with hiring foreigners, to avoid being watched closely and potentially having their applications frozen.
            <br><br>   
                4.	What was said so far should have already convinced you that the playing field is not as even as it seems. 
                But further to that, regardless of the government regulations, what matters is the local culture of the companies. 
                If it’s a locally dominated culture, and that’s the case often even with American MNCs that open here and commit to hiring tons of locals (in exchange of course for favourable tax agreements). 
                Once the management and culture is locally dominated, it becomes not very uncommon to see job ads that say “in order to maintain a local culture / core / whatever / the job is available only to singaporeans …etc”. 
                Or even when they don’t say it in the ad, they understand internally that the position is exclusively for locals and other CVs will be rejected by default.
            <br><br>
                5.	So in essence, to get a job in Singapore you’d better be 1. from an another Asian nationality of their liking and possibly speak a language that can help cover 
                another asian market (Singapore is a hub for asia pacific), 2. with a very specific background they can’t find locally. 
                Example AI expert, then you can find easily but remember they want foreigners to “absorb the know how” so be ready to be sent home 
                when this is no longer necessary as that’s the long term gain. But if your skill is extremely relevant, you’ll always have a way in. 3. Alternatively you have to find ideally a company where the management is foreigner, 
                and is open to hiring foreigners. I would say out of 10 job ads you see, probably 9 you’re out by default as foreigner and 1 you can actually compete for.
            <br><br>            
                6.	Having said all this, if you can land a job in Singapore, it’s really a blessing. 
                Low income tax, safe place, can travel everywhere, super efficient and organised etc. 
                So definitely worth all the struggle. But we have to be honest in saying it can truly be an uphill battle and more so with every year. 
                It’s not what it used to be 5, 10 or 15 years ago when people could land a PR like buying a coffee at Starbucks. 
                These days even renewing one’s own PR has become a struggle and getting a new one… don’t get me started. 
                You just gotta be prepared that the place isn’t foreign friendly and not an even playing field, despite the official information. 
                But persevering at working and moving here, can be a worthwhile effort too.

                <strong style="cursor: pointer;">Where I can get the cheapest price in online shopping?</strong><br><br>
    
                No online shopping site can be described as the cheapest, as different sites may have different prices and promotions at different times. 
                In addition, the price also depends on the type and brand of the product you are buying, 
                and different brands and product lines have different prices.
            <br><br>
            <div class="hide-content3">
                Therefore, if you want to find the cheapest prices in online shopping, 
                it is recommended that you compare on multiple sites. You can use price comparison sites or apps like Google Shopping, 
                PriceGrabber, Shopzilla, etc. These sites help you search and compare product prices in different online stores. 
                In addition, you can also pay attention to the promotion and discount information of major e-commerce platforms, 
                or get the latest discount information by subscribing to the mailing list or social media account.
                
                I recommend you to use FashionTIY, all clothing, shoes, jewelry, home, accessories, etc. 
                can be purchased for you in one stop from their website and app, they provide 70%+ cheap variety of products, and update a large number of high-quality products every day.

                        What is the logic behind the valuation of stocks?</strong>
                    <br><br>
                        A long time ago, humans ran businesses with just their money. The businesses they ran were small and they grew 
                        the businesses only with their own profits. However, not all businesses can be built with your own money. 
                        What if you wanted to build a new factory that costs more than a million dollars? Banks won't lend money for young companies and 
                        your friends won't have that much. In the 15th-16th century as the Europeans started exploring Asia and Americas, 
                        the big explorers felt they needed a lot of money and their kings were not providing them anymore. 
                        The wealthy guys demanded a lot of interest. Thus, they felt they need to raise money from a bunch of common people. 
                        Thus, in 1602, the Dutch East Indian company became the first company to issue shares of its company in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange 
                        and get traded on a continuous basis.

                        What is a Stock? Stocks in a company provide you a share of the company's future profits in return for the capital invested. 
                        For instance, if you buy 1 stock of Apple now, you will be assured one-billionth of Apple's profits in the 
                        future (as there are almost a billion such stocks that Apple has issued now).
                    <br><br>
                        Listing: In a stock market, 1000s of companies are listed and these companies (called public companies - as they 
                        have given out their shares to common public) pay a fee to the exchanges, along with a promise to provide all 
                        important info to the markets. In return they get an opportunity to put their company in the stock market's board & 
                        have the ability to get money from people visiting the market. The first time a company's stock appears on the stock 
                        market's board is called an IPO (Initial Public Offer).
                    <br><br>
                        Brokers: Conceptually, a stock exchange is similar to eBay. These guys allow companies to be listed and connect 
                        the buyers & sellers. Since millions of people trade in the market and it is practically impossible for these 
                        exchanges to deal with all the individuals, they have assigned brokers who act between the exchanges and the individuals.
