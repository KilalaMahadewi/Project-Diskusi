                    <strong>Why are Japanese and Chinese students always at the top in all international scientific 
                        competitions like Science Olympiad and ISEF?</strong><br><br>

                    During the International Physics Olympiad 2015, we were taken to an amusement park. 
                    It was a very hot day as I went to chill in a store where I noticed the Chinese physics team sitting there.

                    I hesitantly (and, quite shyly) approached them to 
                    initiate a conversation and maybe learn with which materials these top-scorers studied.
                    <br> 
                    During the conversation, I asked “so how did you guys do in the tests?”
                    <br>
                    While their answer was a simple “we did well” their smile indicated more than that: 
                    “C’mon, do you really need to ask?!”
                    <br>
                    And, it’s true: asking them how they did was nothing but a formality. 
                    As far as I remember, the team of China has won gold medals for several consecutive years.
                    <br>
                    The question that bugged my mind at the time was how? why? what do these guys do that we don’t?
                    <br>
                    During my conversation with the Chinese team, I learned three facts: 
                    <br><br>
                    1. THEY WORKED MORE THAN 10 HOURS EVERY DAY.
                    <br><br>
                    Each of the five members of the Chinese team said 
                    that they worked more than ten hours each day for at least a year. 
                    <br>
                    Can you imagine that? 10 hours. Each day. More than a year. At least 4000 hours.
                    <br>
                    EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. OF. THEM.
                    <div class="content"> <!-- Hide Content  --> 
                    <br><br>
                    2. THERE WERE AROUND 50 PEOPLE BEHIND THEM
                    <br><br>
                    The selective round in China is very fierce. 
                    The guys I talked to told me that there were around 50 people having same level of skills as they had.
                    <br>
                    In other words, in China, you are not really special. 
                    If you do not work hard, you do not go to the Olympiad. 
                    All of these factors motivate you to hone your skills each and every single day.
                    <br><br>
                    3. THEIR TEACHERS CREATED SPECIALIZED PROBLEMS FOR THEM
                    <br><br>

                    The Chinese team is so strong in physics that they did not practice with “ordinary” problems like you and I know. 
                    <br>
                    Moreover, they thoroughly practiced for the practical (experimental) round of the physics Olympiad.
                    <br>
                    While there aren’t many experimental problems to solve which can help you hone your experimental skills for the Olympiad, 
                    <br>
                    Chinese teachers and professors were actively engaged in creating new problems for their team.
                    <br>
                    All three of these facts show how serious China prepares for its Olympiads. 
                    <br>
                    So is it genetics? While genetics might play a role, it is quite obvious that what makes China 
                    <br> and Japan teams so powerful is the cultural mindset and hard-work they put in.
                    <br>
                    Are Japanese and Chinese students genetically at an advantage? We can never know without proper research. 
                    <br>
                    (And, in my personal opinion, genetic doesn’t play as significant role as hard-work and discipline.)
